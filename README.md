# Teater

This is a POC web application for restaurant selection, kind of like Tinder but for choosing a lunch spot. A user starts a session, and a geographic position is set based on the location of the user. Other users can join the session and swipe on restaurants in the nearby area. Once all users swipes yes on a restaurant, it's a match. The server is hosted on heroku.

# Start client

The client can be started locally by running 'yarn start' in the web-app folder

# Start server

The server can be started locally by running 'yarn start:dev' in the generator folder
